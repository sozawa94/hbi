This directory contains some examples for input file (.in) and python script to generate the parameter file (.py).

[Simple problems (spatially uniform parameters)]
-2dp.in: a planar fault (plane strain) in a 2D elastic full space
-uni3dp.in: a planar fault in a 3D elastic full space
-uni3dthrust.in: a planar thrust fault (30 deg dip) in a 3D elastic half space

[SCEC SEAS benchmark problems](https://strike.scec.org/cvws/seas/benchmark_descriptions.html)
-bp1.in: BP1
-bp3dip30thrust.in: BP3 thrust fault with dip = 30 degrees
-bp5r.in: BP5 with rectangular elements 
-bp5t.in: BP5 with triangular elements 
-bp6a.in: BP6 with aging law (use main_fv.f90 to compile the code).
-bp7r.in: BP7 (no initial perturbation) with rectangular elements and aging law
-bp7t.in: BP7 (no initial perturbation) with triangular elements and aging law
